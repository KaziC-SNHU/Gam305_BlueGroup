## <ins>Brainstorming Scenario, Theme, and Additions</ins>
We opened our discussion with a decision on the main scenario. We decided on developing a fantasy-esque 3D sidescroller where the player is attempting to reach the end of the scenario through various obstacles.\
The player will have to utilize their available spells, navigate their environment, and solve simple puzzle to move through obstacles.\
These obstacles include enemies, hazards, moving hazards, small button puzzles, moving doors, and various other items.\
Additions we've officially decided on include the following:
- Player Pickups, Including but not necessarily limited to health, spell charges, and \[insert third here]
- Player Buff Collectibles that boost the player's stats such as maximum mana and new abilities
- Collectible objects that add to the player's score (just for fun)
- Enemies that move or fly based on their type, dealing damage to the player and providing a target for spells
- Objects and Hazards that sometimes move to cause the player to think on their feet and provide interest and challenge to the game\
~~Apparrently just all of the additions~~

## <ins>Timeline</ins>
Week 6 is the due date for what is essentially the final version of the game. Backtracking from there, week 5 is the due date for the beta, and week 4 is the due date for the alpha.\
Our timeframe, as denoted in our [Traceability Matrix & Test Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SxsREcejOCHreUQ_BOJgph043edeALFdYJSkJ14a3J0/edit?gid=1693832793#gid=1693832793) document, will abide by this,
and all features listed for each stage of release will be completed to the best of our abilities.

## <ins>Alpha Stage</ins>
Alpha stage is planned to include a basic level blockout, essential controls for the player character and camera, one usable spell, at least one enemy, and a few collectibles.

## <ins>Beta Stage</ins>
The Beta Stage is planned to include essentially the entirety, or most of, the playable game. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, developed levels, obstacles, enemies, collectibles,
a minimum of three spells, fleshed out pickups, and anything else that is required for the game submission.

## <ins>Communication</ins>
Preferred communication method may change as required, but for the moment we are present in the class discord through text and voice chat.\
In addition, the Test Plan document exists for required information, and emails are available.\
Communication will happen as frequently as is possible and necessary, especially when communicating about tasks or discussions such as this.\
The goal is to meet at least three times a week to discuss project work as well as to make general progress, but more or less meetings may occur as necessary.\
Task assignments are handled through the aforementioned [Traceability Matrix & Test Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SxsREcejOCHreUQ_BOJgph043edeALFdYJSkJ14a3J0/edit?gid=1693832793#gid=1693832793) document.

## Test Planning
Our testplanning includes a page in our Traceability matrix document including reports, dates, checklists, and the function tested.
This also is a place for recording bugs, resolutions, and changes regarding the aforementioned bugs.
We regularly test work done by ourselves or other developers as well, conferring about it in text or voice chats.
This regular testing is currently primarily focused on our pre-production phase work (the pre-alpha).
However, this also applies to when we move to our demo: Regular tests will be conducted on features as they come along,
and just as well major tests will be done on playability and the 'vibe' of the game once a week. This is especially important before major releases or submissions.
